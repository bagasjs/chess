# Bagas' Chess Implementation
My own  simple chess implementation

## TODO
- Pawn Movement (minus en-passant)
- King Movement 
- Check and check mates
- Basically a working standard chess engine
- Simple GUI (Web based with WebAssembly?)
- Supporting UCI?
- GUI but from UCI?
- Integrating a Chess AI?
